# Charlize
Charlize is an expiration date management decentralized application (Dapp) to optimize regulated reagents utilization in medical research. Charlize's scope may broaden to medications handled in the clinic and food in wholesale and retailer stores, complementing supply chain management operations.

In medical research, chemical agents for treating subjects undergo random inspections to comply with regulatory agencies. As a result, expired reagents are a common motive of sanctions. To address this concern, manufacturers, retailers, and final users may register themselves on Charlize. Once validated by the Dapp, they can enter per product, expiration date, National Drug Code (NDC), and lot numbers. Information that will remain immutable. Since this information uniquely identifies a product, Charlize will avoid reagent duplications.

 Users will receive information about the expiration dates of the chemical agents in two ways: 1) by directly querying Charlize or 2) via email from the Dapp when the reagent expiration date is approaching. Thus, users may reorder the product and adequately discard the expired one.
